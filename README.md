# 3D PDA integration for Chernobyl Relay Chat Rebirth, maintained by Brzys
 Chernobyl Relay Chat Rebirth is an IRC-based chat app for Anomaly, originally developed by TKGP for CoC. Features an independent client as well as in-game chat, automatic death messages, and compatibility with all other add-ons.
 This mod integrates it into the Anomaly 3D PDA

# Compatibility with GAMMA
Gamma uses iTheon's PDA Taskboard, so CRCR will additionally need a patch to ensure compatibility with it (CRCR_iTheon_PDA_Taskboard_compatibility_patch.zip). Once you install it, CRCR should work without problems with the GAMMA mod pack.

# Compatibility with non-US keyboard layouts
Stalker reads the key position on the keyboard ([DIK](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DIK_KeyCodes)) rather than its value after being pressed. For example, when using AZERTY, you don't have to manually change W to Z; you simply press Z, and the game interprets it as W. However, a problem arises when typing in the chat. You need to specifically remember which character on your AZERTY keyboard corresponds to the QWERTY character.

This is not a problem anymore; install [MCM](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/anomaly-mod-configuration-menu) and change the keyboard layout to one of the many available (currently 55). 

I don't promise that everything will work perfectly (Stalker in the English version doesn't support many characters, such as £, ń, ł, Æ, ř, etc.). Additionally, different languages have varying approaches to entering diacritical marks. Sometimes it's `AltGr + character`, sometimes `AltGr + number`, and the combinations can be different and sometimes quite complex ([look up how to type Czech characters with a háček XD](https://www.czechtime.cz/article/how-to-type-czech-characters-on-keyboard/)). I don't have the energy to implement this for all 55 supported languages, especially considering that most of the obtained characters are not supported in Stalker.

I tried to adjust the keys as best I could. However, if you think that any key could be assigned better or if there's a particular character missing, please create an issue or let me know on Discord (amon_de_shir). The layouts were generated by a script, so there's definitely room for improvement.

# Does it work with other PDA related mods?
If mod doesn't modify the `pda.set_active_subdialog` function, there shouldn't be any problems.
